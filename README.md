Project Overview:
This project involves the design, implementation, and management of a relational database system in MySQL to efficiently handle health insurance claims. The system is designed to support the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of critical information related to patients, insurance plans, claims, policyholders, and insurance companies.  The primary goal is to facilitate accurate tracking of claim statuses, precise calculation of claim amounts, and the generation of essential reports to streamline health insurance administration processes. 


Key Features and Demonstrated Skills:

Database Design (ER Diagram): Developed a robust Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram illustrating the schema for health insurance data, including relationships between patients, insurance plans, policies, claims, and claim details.

Schema Definition:
Patients: Manages individual patient records and contact details. 
Insurance Plans: Defines coverage and premium details for various plans. 
Claims: Tracks patient claims, their status, and links to patient records. 
Claim Items (formerly Claims Details): Provides itemized information for each claim. 
Insurance Companies: Stores details of insurance providers. 
Policy Holders: Links patients to their respective insurance plans, including policy start and end dates.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): Implemented INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations for managing records across all tables, including sample data insertion and status updates. 

Data Querying and Filtering: Proficiently used SELECT statements with various clauses such as WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, IS NULL, LIKE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY for precise data retrieval and filtering. 
Advanced SQL Techniques:
Sorting, Distinct, and Pagination: Utilized DISTINCT, ORDER BY, and LIMIT/OFFSET for presenting unique values, ordered results, and paginated data. 
Aggregate Functions & Grouping: Applied COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX with GROUP BY and HAVING to perform data aggregation and generate summary reports. 
Joins: Demonstrated ability to combine data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and multi-table joins to retrieve comprehensive information (e.g., patient names with claim amounts and insurance plan names). 
Subqueries: Employed subqueries for complex data retrieval, such as selecting claims above the average amount or identifying patients with specific claim conditions. 
String and Date/Time Functions: Applied various string manipulation functions (CONCAT, UPPER, LOWER, SUBSTRING, REPLACE, LEFT, RIGHT, REVERSE)  and date/time functions (extracting years, months, days; calculating date differences; adding/subtracting dates)  for data formatting and analysis.

Conditional Logic (CASE): Implemented CASE statements for conditional categorization and ordering of data (e.g., categorizing patients by age group, ordering claims by status). 

Views: Created SQL views (e.g., Patients Claim Summary, Public Patient Details) to simplify complex queries and provide tailored data access
